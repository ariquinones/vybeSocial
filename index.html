					<li><input type="checkbox" class="toggleDescription"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-right arrowIcon fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="question">Why do I need Social Media for my business?</span>
						<p class="toggling-content">
							There are several reasons a business would needs social media, so let's discuss a few:<br>

							There are customers searching for your business right now!<br>
							Regardless of whatever industry you may be in, if you are offering something, you better believe that there are people talking about it and/or looking for it. The world revolves around the internet and more specifically social media. Don’t be left out of the conversation because you aren’t engaged in the social media world.<br>
							It improves your customer service and communication.<br>
							The key to a recurrent customer is the relationships you maintain with them. The best part about social media is that you are able to be wherever your customers are as soon as they log in. It is important that you keep them engaged and connected to your brand, no matter what that may be, so that you are always their first option.<br>
							Users are receptive to your messages.<br>
							Unlike most marketing methods and techniques that may get ignored, Facebook, Twitter, other social medias are viewed as just that, social medias. Therefore the posts and messages you send on social medias are listened to and viewed in turn translating them into serious web traffic and potential sales for you.<br>
							Your competition is getting social, so you should too!<br>
							Did you know that 91% of brands are using more than one social media platform? This isn’t something you want to fall behind the competition on, because it’s much harder (and more expensive) to play catch up than it is to get in on the game early.

						<p class="toggling-content">
							Large-scale alien invasion or zombie apocalypse. Even then though social media can be used to spread the word about safe houses, where to find food, see if your family is in a safe place, etc…..So social media will ALWAYS be important! Great question though.
